        <td class="propseparatorright">
          Proposition A is the $7.2b plan to add three new rail lines and an
          expanded, all-electric bus fleet with more rapid lines across the
          city. Included in this plan is a new Red Line station directly on the stadium grounds at McKalla Place, with all three new rail lines connecting directly to the Red Line for matchday travel ease.<br />
          <b
            >We support this proposition because we believe it's time for a bold
            investment in the future of Austin's transit system.</b
          >
          This proposition will help all Austinites get to work in a more
          efficient, climate-friendly manner during the week, and get us all to
          McKalla Place without having to fight traffic on matchdays.

          Proposition B will build new trails, sidewalks, and safer streets
          across the city. Among the highlights of the plan include $80m for
          sidewalks, $80m for urban trails, $40m for bikeways, and a new
          pedestrian bridge near Longhorn Dam on the east reaches of Lady Bird
          Lake.
